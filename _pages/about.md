Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Engineering Product Development (EPD) Pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I hold a B.S. (2015), M.Phil. (2020), and Ph.D. (2024), with a research focus on underactuated aerial robotic systems, nature-inspired UAVs, and sustainable aerial technologies. My work explores innovative designs for scalable, adaptive, and reconfigurable aerial vehicles.
