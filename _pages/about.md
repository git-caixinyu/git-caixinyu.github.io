Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Engineering Product Development (EPD) Pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I hold a B.S. (2015), M.Phil. (2020), and Ph.D. (2024), with a research focus on underactuated aerial robotic systems, nature-inspired UAVs, and sustainable aerial technologies. My work explores innovative designs for scalable, adaptive, and reconfigurable aerial vehicles.

Research Goal
======
My goal is to develop next-generation UAVs that are not only highly efficient, adaptive, and scalable but also sustainable. By harnessing __solar power__ and __wind energy__, I explore novel aerial designs that extend flight endurance and reduce reliance on conventional energy sources. My research integrates __bio-inspired flight mechanisms__, __energy-efficient propulsion__, and __underactuated control strategies__ to push the boundaries of autonomous and environmentally friendly aerial systems.

Achievement
======
My research has led to multiple publications in top-tier robotics and control conferences and journals. I have developed a high-efficiency aerial robot with a hovering power loading of 9.1 g/W, significantly outperforming conventional UAVs. Additionally, my work on lightweight, nature-inspired monocopters explores novel flight control strategies for underactuated aerial systems. My contributions to aerial robotics have been recognized with the Outstanding Dynamics and Control Award (ICRA 2022), highlighting the impact of my research in scalable and reconfigurable UAV technologies.
